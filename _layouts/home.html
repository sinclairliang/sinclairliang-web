    If I had my life to live over again,
    I’d dare to make more mistakes next time.
    I’d relax.
    I’d limber up.
    I’d be sillier than I’ve been this trip.
    I would take fewer things seriously.
    I would take more chances,
    I would eat more ice cream and less beans.

    I would, perhaps, have more actual troubles but fewer imaginary ones.
    you see, I’m one of those people who was sensible and sane,
    hour after hour,
    day after day.

    Oh, I’ve had my moments.
    If I had to do it over again,
    I’d have more of them.
    In fact, I’d try to have nothing else- just moments,
    one after another, instead of living so many years ahead of each day.

    I’ve been one of those persons who never goes anywhere without a thermometer, a hot-water bottle, a raincoat, and a parachute.
    If I could do it again, I would travel lighter than I have.

    If I had to live my life over,
    I would start barefoot earlier in the spring
    and stay that way later in the fall.
    I would go to more dances,
    I would ride more merry-go-rounds,
    I would pick more daisies.
