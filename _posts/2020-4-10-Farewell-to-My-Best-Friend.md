## Farewell to My Best Friend in College

Nicole M. will always be my best friend, even after college.

<p id="poem-full">
I could skip a heartbeat, and I would survive.<br>
I could be in a car crash and still be alive.<br>
The clouds could fall out of the sky.<br>
The oceans could disappear and all turn dry.<br>
<br>
These things in life are all bad, I know, <br>
but there's far worse things, just thought you should know. <br>
<br>
Life would not be the same without someone like you.<br>
You're there when I need you to help me through.<br>
Through the good times and through the bad,<br>
Be them happy or be them sad.<br>
<br>
I don't have to be with you to know you're there.<br>
We don't have to see each other to know that we care.<br>
We could be apart for years upon end<br>
and still remain the best of friends.<br>
<br>
Life goes on, and people change,<br>
And through it all, our friendship shall remain the same.<br>
That's such as life and how things come to be.<br>
Just thought you should know how much you mean to me!
