### Before Graduation

Santa Cruz has been a place filled with happiness and joy and countless memories for me. After all, I spent the last 4 years in this tiny costal college town, met so many people who influenced me in more than one way. I got a job offer after graduation in the Midwest. On a random Saturday during a barbecue I asked Brandon if he could drop me off at the airport in San Jose after some Friday on which I was supposed to graduate. Brandon told me he could actually drive me all the way to Nebraska, where a new chapter of my life will then begin. So I worked on our itinerary. I did not drive so it would be better if we could get more people to join us in this road trip. Eventually Colin M. and Nick H. joined our group. We planned to leave in the morning of Friday, the 12th of June. 

This was our original plan, according to which we would stay in Salt Lake City for two nights and then drive all the way to Omaha.

### My Last Day in Santa Cruz

Despite of finishing my last essay in Advanced Ethics a couple days early, I still had a presentation with Cisco Team on a project we worked on for the past two quarters. The presentation was a success for all of us. For the rest of that afternoon I spent a few hours with G. R. at the Natural Bridges Beach, it was very peaceful. That night I called up Arielle, Nick, J. Nover and Curry to come drink with me and Leo. Leo was staying over at my house at that time.

I had not started packing at the time yet, at around 9 pm. Arielle and I drove to the West Cliff to pick up Curry and then Nick to my house. We then started drinking. It was bitter sweet because I knew it was probably my last time hanging out with them all together. While we were drinking I started packing, which actually lasted longer then the party. The party ended relatively early because everyone was already tired from this dreadful quarter and finals week. People started leaving around midnight. I spent the next 4 hours putting my 4 years of college stories into 6 boxes, two duffle bags and a big suitcase.

### The Day We Left

I woke up at 8 am, when we were supposed to leave Santa Cruz. Colin was on his way, Nick still had to move his senior project to the Homeless Garden, Sophie wanted to take a last picture of us before we all parted. So many things going on, so little time. Brandon arrived with Sophie, it turned out I couldn't fit all my boxes into his Chevrolet so I had to mail them via USPS and only kept some stuff with me in the car. So we quickly drove to USPS and mailed some boxes.

We then rushed back home and waited for Nick. Leo and Colin was already helping Nick move his project to the Homeless Garden and on their way back. When everyone was back to my house, the hub before we all parted for different directions, we decided to take one last picture. For some reason we could not get a group pic, but here is one Sophie wanted.

Sophie ubered back to her home and we cleaned up the last bit of my stuff in the house. I then had only one pillow and one comforter left. I put threw them out and yelled: "Bye Santa Cruz, bye college."

### First Stop: The Place that Always Has My Heart

After driving in the Bay Area from one BestBuy to another just to find a car charger for Brandon's laptop, we finally arrived in San Francisco around 2 pm. Apparently UCSC mailed some kind of tote bag and some pins to my home as my graduation gifts. I would like to check out how good they are because they cost so much of my tuition for four years. How good can they be? 

Right before we got to my house we saw this super slant road. We were amazed. It reminded me of the days I biked to school during high school years. We got out of the car and took our first set of road trip pictures.

There we stood at the end of this continent...no more land... only the Pacific in front us. We got in the car, made a right turn on the 21st and Castro, we again had the whole continent in front of us. 


### "Downtown Davis"

Once we crossed the Bay Bridge, Central Valley heat wrapped us around in the car. We filled our journey to Davis with jokes and anecdotes about people we met during college. At around 6 pm we approached Davis, Calif. Colin suggested to have dinner there. Since none of us was familiar with Davis, we set the Woodstock's as our destination so that we can wander around Davis from there. Nick was the one that had the wheel as we were approaching Davis, and I, was the one holding the GPS. This is the road sign I saw and Nick asked me which direction to take. I said: "Downtown." Lol
