### Before Graduation

Santa Cruz has been a place filled with happiness and joy and countless memories for me. After all, I spent the last 4 years in this tiny costal college town, met so many people who influenced me in more than one way. I got a job after graduation in the Midwest. On a random Saturday during a barbecue I asked Brandon if he could drop me off at the airport in San Jose after some Friday on which I was supposed to graduate. Brandon told me he could actually drive me all the way to Nebraska, where a new chapter of my life will then begin. So I worked on the itinerary for us. I did not drive so it would be better if we could get more people to join us in this road trip. Eventually Collin M. and Nick H. joined our group. We planned to leave in the morning of Friday, the 12th of June.

### My Last Day in Santa Cruz

Despite of finishing my last essay in Advanced Ethics a couple days ago, I still had a presentation with Cisco Team on a project we worked on for the past two quarters. The presentation was a success for all of us. That afternoon I spent a few hours with G. R. at the Natural Bridges Beach, it was very peaceful. That night I called up Arielle, Nick, J. Nover and Curry to come drink with me and Leo. Leo was staying over at my house at that time.
