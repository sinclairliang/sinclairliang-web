### Before Graduation

Santa Cruz has been a place filled with happiness and joy and countless memories for me. After all, I spent the last 4 years in this tiny costal college town, met so many people who influenced me in more than one way. I got a job after graduation in the Midwest. On a random Saturday during a barbecue I asked Brandon if he could drop me off at the airport in San Jose after some Friday on which I was supposed to graduate. Brandon told me he could actually drive me all the way to Nebraska, where a new chapter of my life will then begin. So I worked on the itinerary for us. I did not drive so it would be better if we could get more people to join us in this road trip. Eventually Collin M. and Nick H. joined our group. We planned to leave in the morning of Friday, the 12th of June. 

This was our original plan. We would stay in Salt Lake City for two nights and all the way to Omaha.

### My Last Day in Santa Cruz

Despite of finishing my last essay in Advanced Ethics a couple days ago, I still had a presentation with Cisco Team on a project we worked on for the past two quarters. The presentation was a success for all of us. That afternoon I spent a few hours with G. R. at the Natural Bridges Beach, it was very peaceful. That night I called up Arielle, Nick, J. Nover and Curry to come drink with me and Leo. Leo was staying over at my house at that time.

I had not started packing at the time yet, at around 9 pm. Arielle and I drove to the West Cliff to pick up Curry and then Nick to my house. We started drinking, I knew it was probably my last time hanging out with them all together. While we were drinking I started packing, which actually lasted longer then the party. The party did not really last long because everyone was already tired from this dreadful quarter and finals week. People started leaving around midnight. I spent the next 4 hours putting my 4 years of college stories into 6 boxes, two duffle bags and a big suitcase.

### The Day We Left

I woke up at 8 am, when we were supposed to leave Santa Cruz. Collin was on his way, Nick still had to move his senior project to the Homeless Garden, Sophie wanted to take a last picture of us before we all parted. So many things going on, so little time. Brandon arrived with Sophie, it turned out I couldn't fit all my boxes into his Chevrolet so I had to mail them via USPS and only kept some stuff with me in the car. So we quickly drove to USPS and mailed some boxes.
