It is not my first time being in the UK but it is probably the only time I felt I did not enough during my stay.


I am gonna miss the time wandering around on Grey Street and went in to a bar in the middle of night in Newcastle, taking funny Salsa classes in London, making new friends during whiskey tour in Edinburgh.


I am also gonna miss unexpected hugs, talks before sleeps and jokes I shared, laughters exchanged. Winds in Scotland. The ten-minute sunshine once in a while. The first sip of latte in chilly September. Long walks.

I am going home, babes. Let's have some damn good time back in Santa Cruz.
